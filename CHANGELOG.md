## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

#### 🎨 Terminal UI
- **`ui.py`** — New centralized UI module with colorama color constants, styled print helpers (`success()`, `error()`, `warning()`, `info()`), password masking via getpass, and cross-platform screen clearing.
- **Colored output across all modules** — Green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings, cyan for info/labels, and bold for emphasis.
- **Password masking** — All password prompts now use `getpass` so characters are not echoed to screen.
- **Box-drawn menu frames** — Main menu and admin panel have colored Unicode box-drawing frames.
- **Colored transaction statements** — Credits displayed in green, debits in red.
- **Colored account status badges** — ACTIVE (green), FROZEN (red), CLOSED (yellow).

#### 💾 JSON Storage Hardening
- **Auto-backup** — Every save creates a `.bak` copy of the previous file version.
- **Corruption recovery** — On load, if JSON is corrupted, automatically restores from backup.
- **Atomic writes** — Writes go to a temp file first, then are atomically renamed (reduces corruption risk).
- **Graceful fallback** — If both file and backup are corrupted, resets to empty state with a log warning.

### Changed

- **`utils.py`** — `load_json()` and `save_json()` completely rewritten with backup, atomic write, and corruption recovery. Removed `header()` and `divider()` (moved to `ui.py`).
- **`bank.py`** — All display output migrated to `ui.py` helpers. Passwords now masked via `prompt_password()`. Customer menus colored cyan with white options.
- **`account.py`** — Statements, profile, and transaction screens colored. Passwords masked. Credits green, debits red.
- **`admin.py`** — Statistics box has green frame with colored metrics. Account list has colored status badges. Passwords masked.
- **`main.py`** — Main menu uses green frame with yellow title and cyan options.
- **`requirements.txt`** — Added `colorama>=0.4.6`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

#### 🔒 Security
- **bcrypt password hashing** — All passwords (customer & admin) are now hashed with salted bcrypt before storage. Plain-text passwords are never written to disk.
- **Automatic password migration** — Existing `data/admin.json` with plain-text passwords is automatically migrated to bcrypt on startup.
- **Password strength validation** — New passwords must be at least 8 characters with at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 digit. Enforced during registration and password changes.

#### ✅ Input Validation
- **Email validation** — Format verified via regex (`user@example.com`). Rejects malformed addresses.
- **Indian mobile validation** — 10-digit numbers starting with 6–9. Rejects invalid formats.
- **Name validation** — Letters and spaces only, 2–50 characters. Rejects empty or invalid names.
- **Age validation** — Checks for valid integer input, minimum age of 18, and a reasonable maximum (120).

#### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
- **35 unit tests** covering password hashing, all validators, generators, currency formatting, JSON helpers, and amount validation.
- **Smoke tests** verifying all 6 modules import correctly without errors.
- **pytest configuration** in `pyproject.toml` with test discovery rules.
- **Coverage configuration** targeting 80% minimum coverage.

#### ⚙️ Project Tooling
- **`.gitignore`** — Ignores `__pycache__`, virtual environments, IDE folders, runtime data files, logs, and OS artifacts.
- **`requirements.txt`** — Lists `bcrypt`, `pytest`, and `pytest-cov` dependencies.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — Project metadata (name, version, Python 3.10+), build system config, and pytest/coverage settings.

#### 📄 Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Comprehensive project documentation with overview, features, project structure, installation guide, usage instructions, testing guide, technology stack, roadmap, and contributing guidelines.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This file — structured changelog following Keep a Changelog format.

### Changed

- **`bank.py`** — Registration and login now use `hash_password()` and `verify_password()` instead of plain-text comparison.
- **`account.py`** — Password changes and account closure now use bcrypt verification. New passwords are hashed before storage.
- **`admin.py`** — Admin login, password changes, and credential initialization now use bcrypt. Existing passwords auto-migrate.
- **`utils.py`** — Added `hash_password()`, `verify_password()`, `validate_email()`, `validate_phone()`, `validate_password()`, and `validate_name()` functions.
